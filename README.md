All the five can meet on a website with an [etherpad-lite](http://etherpad.org/) instance running to answer the question.

If there is no answer in 90 minutes an excuse is sent.

## Help me coding this beast! finally a world order?
Currently my skills don't allow to code a component as it should work that I call the "[answer-whopper](https://github.com/interbr/amored-police/blob/master/html/answer/answerwhopper.php)".
It's checking if the help-desk-agents are satisfied with the answer yet and it offers to send the answer when 3 of 5 agents click a button "Are you satisfied".
Some nodejs would improve the component, that is currently making ajax-calls every 4 seconds to reload a php-file checking the "satisfied"-status to a database.

For questions regarding this question-answer-system or suggestions, please feel free to write to felix@weltpolizei.de
