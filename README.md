#Help Desk for Earth' Peoples Problems (except IT) 

##Platform for people to write to and get questions answered by other people.

Questions are only exposed to a small number of persons.

Currently each question is send to five persons via email. Three of them have to find a collective answer in 90 minutes.

All the five can meet on a website with an [etherpad-lite](http://etherpad.org/) instance running to answer the question.

If there is no answer in 90 minutes an excuse is sent.

To level the propability that at least three people find together to answer, questions can be forwarded by clicking a link in the question-email.

##Help me coding this beast!
Currently my skills don't allow to code a component as it should work that I call the "[answer-whopper](https://github.com/interbr/amored-police/blob/master/html/answer/answerwhopper.php)".
It's checking if the help-desk-agents are satisfied with the answer yet and it offers to send the answer when 3 of 5 agents are click a button "Are you satisfied".
Some nodejs would improve the component, that is currently making ajax-calls every 4 seconds to reload a php-file checking the "satisfied"-status to a database.
