#Help Desk for Earth' Peoples Problems (except IT) 

##Platform for people to write to and get questions answered by other people.

Questions are only exposed to a small number of persons.

Currently each question is send to five persons via email. Three of them have to find a collective answer in 90 minutes.

All the five can meet on a website with an [etherpad-lite](http://etherpad.org/) instance running to answer the question.

If there is no answer in 90 minutes an excuse is sent.

To level the propability that at least three people find together to answer, questions can be forwarded by clicking a link in the question-email.
