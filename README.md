# Help Desk for Earth' Peoples Problems (except IT)

## Platform for people to write to and get questions answered by other people.

https://www.amored-police.org

Questions are only exposed to a small number of persons.

Currently each question is sent to five persons via email. Three of them have time find a collective answer.

All the five can meet on a website with assembled software connected by a software-assembler (neet guy).

If there is no answer in 90 minutes an excuse is sent is not working by the code in this basis.

To level the propability that at least three people find together to answer, questions can be forwarded by clicking a link in the question-email.
